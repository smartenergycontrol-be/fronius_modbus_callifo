# fronius_modbus
This is a fork from redpomodoro/fronius_modbus, with some merged changes and PRs.

Home Assistant custom component for reading data from Fronius GEN24 and Verto inverters, connected smart meters, and battery storage. This integration uses a Modbus-first + authenticated Web API connection model.

It can use the authenticated Fronius web API for setup assistance and battery controls that are not available over Modbus.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a work in progress project - it is still in early development stage, so there are still breaking changes possible.
>
> This is an unofficial implementation and not supported by Fronius. It might stop working at any point in time.
> You are using this module (and it's prerequisites/dependencies) at your own risk. Not me neither any of contributors to this or any prerequired/dependency project are responsible for damage in any kind caused by this project or any of its prerequsites/dependencies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Its recommended to keep the inverter up to date, this integration will only be tested on recent firmwares. It is suggested to update your GEN24 inverter firmware to 1.40.0 or higher as issues have been reported in earlier firmwares of the Solar API caused multiple outages on GEN24 inverters. As of Mar 26, this firmware update has limited availability, so other areas might take longer.

# Installation

## HACS installation

- Go to HACS
- Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.
- Select "Custom repositories"
- Add the [URL](https://github.com/callifo/fronius_modbus) to the repository.
- Select the 'integration' type.
- Click the "ADD" button.

## Manual installation

Copy contents of custom_components folder to your home-assistant config/custom_components folder.
After reboot of Home-Assistant, this integration can be configured through the integration setup UI.

## Multiple Inverters

You can add multiple `fronius_modbus` config entries in Home Assistant for separate inverters.
Entity and device identifiers are scoped per configured hub target so multiple inverters can coexist cleanly even when entries reuse the same display name.

This follows the same multi-instance collision fix that was proposed earlier in redpomodoro/fronius_modbus and later reintroduced in PR #89.

## Inverter Setup

### Web API Assisted Setup

If you provide the inverter Web API customer password in the integration setup, the integration can:

- auto-enable Modbus TCP during setup and relevant configuration changes
- optionally restrict auto-enabled Modbus TCP to the Home Assistant host IP
- derive configured smart meter addresses from `/api/components/PowerMeter/readable`
- expose authenticated battery controls from `/api/config/batteries`
- expose Modbus service diagnostics from `/api/config/modbus`

![solar_login](images/solar_login.jpg?raw=true "storage")

The Web API username is fixed to use the `customer` local login for your inverter. This is the login used when you connect using web browser locally to the inverter by its LAN ip address. This should have been provided by your installer during installation/setup up. This is not the Solar Web login used for the cloud (e.g. https://www.solarweb.com/).
The integration stores a derived digest token in Home Assistant storage and does not keep the password in the config entry.
During setup, reconfigure, options, or Repairs, the password is only requested if no stored token exists for the selected host or the existing token must be refreshed.

### Migrating Older Entries

Entries created with older Modbus-only versions are migrated with safe defaults and keep working temporarily.
If an entry has no valid stored Web API token for the configured host, Home Assistant raises a Repairs item that lets you review the host settings and enter the customer password to mint a new token.

## Charging From Grid

Turn off scheduled (dis)charging in the web UI to avoid unexpected behavior.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using multiple integrations that use pymodbus package it can lead to version conflicts as they will share 1 package in HA. This can be fixed by removing ALL integrations using pymodbus and modbus configuratio.yaml (for the build in integration into HA), rebooting HA and then reinstalling the integrations and the modbus configuration yaml.

# Usage

### Battery Storage

If Web API credentials are configured, the integration exposes both Modbus battery controls and authenticated battery API controls together.
The only built-in cross-protocol synchronization is the SoC minimum:

- while `Battery API Mode` is `Manual`, writing `SoC Minimum` also writes the API SoC minimum and forces API SOC mode to `manual`
- `Battery API Mode` is derived from both `HYB_EM_MODE` and `BAT_M0_SOC_MODE`
- entering Modbus `Charge from Grid` also enables the Web API `Charge from grid` and `Charge from AC` toggles when Web API is configured
- turning on the Web API `Charge from grid` switch also enables `Charge from AC`
- `Target Feed In` is ignored by the inverter when battery charging is unavailable
- if those two API mode signals disagree, `Battery API Mode` shows empty, `Target Feed In` and `SoC Maximum` are disabled, and the API charge-source switches remain usable

This is also auto-enabled when Modbus `Charge from Grid` is selected from the integration.                                                                                                                                       |
| Target Feed In   | Manual Fronius target feed-in in watts. Positive values target feed-in watts. Negative values target grid consumption watts, and the inverter will target that grid consumption even when PV power is available. This setting is ignored by the inverter when battery charging is unavailable. It is disabled unless `HYB_EM_MODE=1` and `BAT_M0_SOC_MODE=\"manual\"`. |
| SoC Maximum      | `BAT_M0_SOC_MAX` from the Web API. Only available when `HYB_EM_MODE=1` and `BAT_M0_SOC_MODE=\"manual\"`, and it must not be set below `SoC Minimum`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Set the Grid Charge Power to a number in Watts, in a multiple of '10'. If the number is not rounded to 10, it will not work and does odd things like charging at 500W. If you need to press 'increment' to get it to charge, its likely the 10 issue. You do not need to fiddle with the 'Minimum Reserve' setting.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC Limit Enable      | Allows limiting inverter AC output. Enable this setting first, and then set the AC limit below.                                 |
| AC Limit Rate        | Sets the AC limit in watts. Internally this is mapped to SunSpec `WMaxLimPct` (% of `WMax`) using the inverter scale factor.    |
| Power Factor Control | Enables or disables the Modbus fixed power factor control (`OutPFSet_Ena`).                                                     |
| Power Factor         | Fixed power factor (`OutPFSet`). Range is `-1.0` to `1.0`. Negative values are over-excited, positive values are under-excited. |

# Example Devices
These images are examples, and have recently changed slightly. They will be grouped into two categories one for the inverter, and one for the battery. Previously the WattMeter was shown separately.
